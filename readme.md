# Compilerbau

This repo contains solutions to the assignments of the "Sprachtechnologie and Compiler" ("Compilerbau" colloquially) lecture at KIT.

## Usage

Currently there is one folder per assignment and the functions provided by each assignment are used in a central `src/compilerbau.nim` file.
This setup is subject to change

```bash
nimble build   # build the program
./compilerbau  # run the binary
```
